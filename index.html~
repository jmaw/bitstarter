		  <p><b>The freelance market</b></p>
		  <p> According to Forbes, there is one important fact of the current and future job marketâ€”the state of the freelance market. The number of freelance workers is projected to outpace full-time workers by 2020.  The economy is rapidly shifting to a more contingent workforce, with recent estimates by the Freelancers Union of 42 million American independent workers, up from 10.3 million workers in 2005</p>

        <p>"Delays in payment usually aren't deliberate on the client's part," notes Sara Horowitz, who founded and runs Freelancers Union, an association that offers health insurance and other resources to the self-employed. "It's just that your invoices get lumped in with all the other accounts payable -- and, especially since the recession, more companies are pushing those out beyond 30 days to 60, or even 90." Intentional or not, she agrees with you that the damage to individuals' livelihoods is "not acceptable."

           According to vWorker, now part of freelancer.com: "it's an unfortunate fact that 42% of traditional freelancers in the USA, are paid late or never at all, and lose $ 4.7 billion a year".
One recent study of self-employed people in New York state, found that 316,000 of them (about 35%) were paid late at least once during the preceding year, and some 214,000 (14%) did work for one or more clients who never paid them at all.

          <p> 
            In the software industry, freelance software developers never get paid on time and only 3.2% of freelance Web developers got paid on time during the year 2012 (Please see 2012 Freelance Industry Report by Ed Gandia). This is awful considering that IT spending is predicted to reach $3.7 trillion worldwide in 2013, a 2 percent increase over last year's levels, according to research firm Gartner.

          <p>Secure Project Payment is a payment service on the Internet based on Bitcoin. Its primary goal is to organize and control the payments in software projects, especially when we are using outsourcing or freelance developers. Its second goal is to protect both developers and project owners from cheating or unfair situations.

              <p>Secure Project Payment is focused on payments schedules or how payments are made from one party to another. In this case, project owners can organize how to pay developers at different phases of the software project. We are not dealing with deadlines or critical path, normally considered by project development methodologies. We create a protocol to pay, once the job is done and accepted. </p>

              <p>We support any traditional payment schedule: paying a deposit at the beginning, paying in every project milestone or paying at the end. All payments are regulated by the Secure Project Payment terms and conditions including cancellation policies to avoid cheating by project owners. </p>

              <p>The waterfall model is a sequential design process, often used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. As all phases are related in a way the product is not ready until Deployment,then it's more likely to define payment milestones in certain phases or at the end of the project.</p>

              <p>Agile software development is  based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams.
